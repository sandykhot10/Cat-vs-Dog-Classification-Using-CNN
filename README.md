# Cat-vs.-Dog-Classification-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This project focuses on classifying images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is built with TensorFlow and Keras, and leverages deep learning techniques to accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The project demonstrates the use of CNNs for image classification tasks and includes data preprocess.
